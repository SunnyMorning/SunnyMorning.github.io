<p>There are many open source tools for building an embedded Linux system, they are more convenient for embedded software engineers to build bootloader, kernel, filesystem all in one step. Currently, <a href="https://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a>, <a href="http://buildroot.org">Buildroot</a> , <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org">Yocot</a> are more commonly used.</p>
<p>Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation,thanks to its kernel-like menuconfig, gconfig and xconfig configuration interfaces, building a basic system with Buildroot is easy, so itâ€™s very popular among embedded software engineers.</p>
<p>The following sections will explain U-boot, kernel, filesystem respectively, in the part of filesystem, we build a filesystem with QT5 included, customers can develop QT5 application based on this filesystem easily.</p>
