QT5 is included in Buildroot as a target package, we have provided a config file with QT5 for MYD-AM335X series development board, so it is easy to build filesystem images with QT5 shown as below.

```
$ cd <WORKDIR>/Filesystem/myir-buildroot
```
Build Buildroot:

| Config File| Description |
|---------|------|
| myd_c335x_defconfig | Buildroot configuration without QT5 for MYD-AM335X development board |
| myd_c335x_qt5_defconfig | Buildroot configuration with QT5 for MYD-AM335X development board |
| myd_j335x_defconfig | Buildroot configuration without QT5 for MYD-AM335X-J development board |
| myd_j335x_qt5_defconfig | Buildroot configuration with QT5 for MYD-AM335X-J development board |
| myd_y335x_defconfig | Buildroot configuration without QT5 for MYD-AM335X-Y development board |
| myd_y335x_qt5_defconfig | Buildroot configuration with QT5 for MYD-AM335X-Y development board |

* MYD-AM335X with qt5ï¼š

```c
$ make myd_c335x_qt5_defconfig
$ make menuconfig 
$ make
```

After compiling with the config file `myd_c335x_qt5_defconfig`, all the target images are generated at path `myir-buildroot/output/images`. Beyond that, a cross compiler and a qmake tools are generated at path `myir-buildroot/output/host` after building QT5 applications. These will be described in detail in the subsequent sections.
