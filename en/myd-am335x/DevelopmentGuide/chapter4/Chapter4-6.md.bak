This example demonstrates how to use Linux APIs to send and receive data from Network port, please refer to the source code for detail.

**Hardware Preparation: **
  * Hardware debugging environment to see [chapter2](/en/myd-am335x/DevelopmentGuide/chapter2/chapter2).


  | Board Type | MYD-AM335X | MYD-AM335X-Y | MYD-AM335X-J |
  | ----| ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | Network port interface | Cable connection J5 | Cable connection J5 | Cable connection J5|


**Software Preparation: **
  * Linux Kernel 4.1.18
  * server application
  * client applicatoin

**Test Steps:**

Copy cross compiled `<WORKDIR>/Examples/network/client` to `/usr/bin` directory of the MYD-AM335x series development board,Copy cross compiled `<WORKDIR>/Examples/network/server` to  ubuntu 12.04.Assume that the ubuntu12.04 ip is 192.168.30.114.

Configure the development board ipï¼š
```
ifconfig eth0 192.168.30.122 up
```
Configure the network, the development board eth0 connected to the PC with a network cable,to the virtual machine as the server, the development board for the client, first in the virtual machine to execute the following command:

```c
$./server 192.168.30.122
```

And then in the development board to execute the following command to see the information sent:

```c
# ./client 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
send messages: 1234567890 to 192.168.30.114
```
At the same time you can see the virtual machine to receive the data sent by the development board:

```c
$ ./server 192.168.30.122
received messages: 1234567890@ from 192.168.30.122
received messages: 1234567890@ from 192.168.30.122
received messages: 1234567890@ from 192.168.30.122
received messages: 1234567890@ from 192.168.30.122
