This section focuses on application development based on embedded Linux, the following examples provided by MYIR Tech demonstrate how to take the control of some commonly used peripheral devices through Linux applications. The source code of these examples is located at *04-Linux_Source\Examples* of our release package. Please follow the instructions provided in the readme file to set the environment variables, compile the source code and install the binary files into MYD-AM335X series development board.

```
$ cd <WORKDIR>/Examples/
```
Make sure the following environment variables are right.
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:<WORKDIR>/Toolchain/
gcc-linaro-5.3-2016.02-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin
$ export ARCH=arm
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
```
After building Buildroot, a cross compile toolchain has been created at *myir-buildroot/output/host/usr/bin*, it can be used here by setting the environment variables instead of the above.
```
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-myir-linux-gnueabihf-
$ export PATH=$PATH:<WORKDIR>/Filesystem/myir-buildroot/output/host/usr/bin
```
Customers could build examples all in one step:
```
$ cd <WORKDIR>/Examples/
$ make OPTION=MYD-AM335X-SERIES
```
Or build the examples respectively:
```
$ cd <WORKDIR>/Examples/<APP_DIR>
$ make
```
If the binary files have no permission to run, please assign the running permission to them by chmodï¼š

```
# chmod +x *
```
