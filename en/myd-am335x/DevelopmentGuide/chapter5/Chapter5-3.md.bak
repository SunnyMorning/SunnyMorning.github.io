After building,  a binary format QT5 application is generated at *~/build-helloworld-myir_dev_kit-Debug/*, please use `file` command to check it and
make sure it can work on ARM embedded Linux system as below:

```
file helloworld

 (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 4.1.0, not stripped
```

Finaly, please copy the binary format application `helloworld` to `/usr/bin` directory of MYD-AM335X series development board and execute as below:
